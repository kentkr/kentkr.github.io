Divinity is a trading algorithm I developed as a side project to improve my python skills and learn better software engineering. If you would like to install it and run it on your mac, linux, or even a cloud instance, then follow the instructions below.

To learn more about it check out the following links:

[Divinity github repository](https://github.com/kentkr/divinity)

# Quick start guide

## Basic install 

### Clone repository

To install divinity on an OS or linux device then switch into the directory you'd like divinity to be in. Clone the repo then move into the `divinity` directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/kentkr/divinity
cd divinity
```

### Install modules

If you have python version 3.8 already on your device, then use `pip` to install required modules. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Most of the modules are easy to install, but I had trouble getting `prophet` to work properly with python 3.7. If you have trouble then consult stack overflow, install with `conda-forge`, try using python 3.8, or create an issue and I can try and help.  

### Run the algorithm locally

The script is now able to be run with the `--test` flag and allow you to `--plot` the algorithm over the last year. Simply call `python3 scripts/final_scripts/divinity.py --ticker TSLA --plot --test` from the divinity directory. You can replace `TSLA` with any ticker available on yahoo finance.

# Run the algorithm live

To run the algorithm in a paper or live account you first need to sign up for [alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/). It is a free brokerage with zero trading fees.

Next create a file in the root directory called `.env.ini` and add the following to it.

```
# keys for alpaca

# paper keys
[alpaca_paper]
alpaca_paper_key=
alpaca_paper_secret_key=

# real keys
[alpaca_real]
alpaca_real_key=
alpaca_real_secret_key=

```

Then go to your alpaca account get the key and secret key for either your paper or live account. Fill in the keys in the specified places above without quotes or spaces (eg `alpaca_paper_key=ABC123`).

To run the algorithm with a paper account *do not* use the `--test` flag. If you want to use your real account with real money *specify* the `--live` flag.
