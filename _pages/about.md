# About me

My career entry into data science and engineering was not necessarily out of the ordinary, but I did not expect to end up here. It came about by a few constants in my life: a desire to learn, an analytical mindset, and an unrivaled passion for new things. These three traits helped me to graduate Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelors in Psychology from CU Boulder, publish two academic papers in genetics and child abuse, and develop an automated trading algorithm. If you're interested in learning more about these accomplishments then please browse the posts and pages of this website. 

# My current position

I currently work as a data scientist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in the Department of Genetics and Bioinformatics, under the guidance of Douglas Ruderfer. My focus in Doug's lab centers around integrating wearable device data (from garmins, apple watches, etc) and ecological momentary assessments of depression and anxiety into the medical records. I manage this study and all the data associated with it which involves developing ETL pipelines and a SQLite database for us and collaborators to utilize. Other projects related to building features for a suicide risk prediction model and gene-environment interaction studies of phenotypes derived from the medical records using natural language processing. These phenotypes center around child abuse and other social determinants of health.

# Side projects

As was stated in the about me section, I love to learn, and programming really brings that out in me. For instance, during my undergraduate research days I would find myself spending more time than I had alloted for my research because of how R captivated me. Learning tidyr, testing it against data.tables, or learing new plotting layers with ggplot. The best part? It's productive and you can create extremely useful tools from it.

So, to learn python, automation with cloud computers (AWS), and other useful tools, I spent a few hours a week building a trading algorithm divinity. To learn more about it please check out the divinity tab of this webpage.
